## Overview

Audio-Echo-Modelling is a research project focused on simulating environmental echo effects on audio signals using digital filters. The project explores the impact of physical environments, like mountainous regions, on sound propagation and the creation of reverberative effects. By employing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, we aim to recreate the echoes produced when a person calls out in a mountain range.

## Objective

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms of audio signal processing related to echo generation and perception in diverse physical settings. We analyze how digital filters can accurately replicate the echoes that occur in real-world environments, providing valuable insights into the field of audio processing.

# Abstract

This project explores the simulation of environmental echo effects on audio signals using digital filters, aiming to replicate echoes found in mountainous areas when a person calls out. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters are employed, with MATLAB used for implementation and "countdownfrom.mp3" as input. The results confirm the presence of disassembled echoes compared to the original audio. The research sheds light on audio signal processing mechanisms and the perception of echoes in diverse settings, contributing to advancements in audio processing and applications such as acoustic design and virtual reality audio experiences.

Here we have mainly focusing on the Case 3: i,e. Student No - 3; Td1=0.35sec, Td2=0.65sec, G1=0.7, G2=0.3

## Methodology

The methodology involves designing digital filters, calculating delays, and attenuations based on specific parameters, including student numbers. Utilized MATLAB for filter implementation and use the "countdownfrom.mp3" speech file as the input for our simulations. The results are carefully examined and compared against the original audio to demonstrate the presence of disassembled echoes.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- `src/`: This directory contains the MATLAB source code for the digital filters implementation.
- `data/`: Here, you can find the "countdownfrom.mp3" speech file used as input data.
- `results/`: Contains the output audio files generated by the filters and the comparison results.
- `docs/`: Any additional documentation related to the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Sid-WC121/Audio-Echo-Modelling

```
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory and run the MATLAB script to generate the simulated audio echoes.

3. The output audio files are saved in the `results/` directory for further analysis and comparison. The result generated from the code will be saved as `1st_echoed_signal.wav`, `2nd_echoed_signal.wav` and `output_signal.wav`
