## Overview

Audio-Echo-Modelling is a research project focused on simulating environmental echo effects on audio signals using digital filters. The project explores the impact of physical environments, like mountainous regions, on sound propagation and the creation of reverberative effects. By employing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, we aim to recreate the echoes produced when a person calls out in a mountain range.

## Objective

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms of audio signal processing related to echo generation and perception in diverse physical settings. We analyze how digital filters can accurately replicate the echoes that occur in real-world environments, providing valuable insights into the field of audio processing.

# Abstract

This project explores the simulation of environmental echo effects on audio signals using digital filters, aiming to replicate echoes found in mountainous areas when a person calls out. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters are employed, with MATLAB used for implementation and "countdownfrom.mp3" as input. The results confirm the presence of disassembled echoes compared to the original audio. The research sheds light on audio signal processing mechanisms and the perception of echoes in diverse settings, contributing to advancements in audio processing and applications such as acoustic design and virtual reality audio experiences.

## Methodology

The methodology involves designing digital filters, calculating delays, and attenuations based on specific parameters, including student numbers. We utilize MATLAB for filter implementation and use the "countdownfrom.mp3" speech file as the input for our simulations. The results are carefully examined and compared against the original audio to demonstrate the presence of disassembled echoes.
